title: Solidity Course (In Progress)
key: solidity-course
summary: >
  Smart contracts allow users to implement conditions, rules and policies of the
  blockchain applications. 

  In this course you will learn how to write smart contracts and all the
  features of Solidity language.
details: >
  Each smart contract can contain declarations of State Variables, Functions,
  Function Modifiers, Events, Errors, Struct Types, Enum Types etc. 

  Smart Contract development in solidity requires an understanding of the
  solidity compiler, structure of a smart contract, use of various globally
  available functions and variables, expressions and control structures and
  error handling methods.

  In this course, you will learn all these essentials for programming in
  Solidity.

  This course will also cover Object-oriented programming concepts like
  constructor functions, contract and classes, interfaces, abstract contracts
  (virtual and override), inheritance etc.
duration: 4 - 6 hours
