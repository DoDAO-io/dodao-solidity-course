    In this video we're looking at the data types available in Solidity.
    This video explains about the use of -
    * Value Types - Integers , Booleans etc 
    * Reference Types - Structs , Arrays .
    * Mapping Type - Mapping.

    This video explains how to - 
    - Declare arrays
    - Add elements
    - Read elements
    - Update elements
    - Delete elements
    - Iterate through elements  
    
    This video further explores the differences between-
    - Fixed-size and Dynamic size
    - Storage and memory arrays  

    and it also covers how to accept arrays argument in Solidity functions and return arrays from solidity functions.

    Solidity Structs allow you to represent structured data. This video explains how to declare, instantiate (create), read, update and delete structs in Solidity.
    It will also show some more advanced struct manipulation like how to declare an array of structs and how to declare a mapping of structs.
