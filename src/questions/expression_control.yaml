  hint: Else statement
  explanation: Else statement can be defined only when the `if` statement is defined prior to it and they should be continuous i.e, no codes should lie between them.

  hint: Doesn't exist
  explanation: Else if doesn't exist in solidity. `Else if` is also a statement like `if` but it will be executed only if all of the preceding `if` or `else if` statements in the code block are false. Else if do exist in other programming langiages like c,c++, JavaScript.
