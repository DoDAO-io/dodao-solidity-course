  content: Can we define `else if` block in Solidity?
  hint: Doesn't exist
  explanation: Else if doesn't exist in solidity. `Else if` is also a statement like `if` but it will be executed only if all of the preceding `if` or `else if` statements in the code block are false. Else if do exist in other programming langiages like c,c++, JavaScript.
