 ## Expressions and Control Structures

##### What will happen if we declared `else` statement without any if statement?  

- [ ]  Compiler checks for the condition in the else statement
- [ ]  It will be executed
- [x]  Error message will appear
- [ ]  Nothing will happen
  
Hint: Else statement
         
Explanation: Else statement can be defined only when the `if` statement is defined prior to it and they should be continuous i.e, no codes should lie between them.

##### Which of the following is/are correct?  

- [x]  We can have multiple `if` statements continously
- [ ]  We can have only one `if` statement continuously
- [ ]  We can have multiple `else` statement under `if` statements continously
- [x]  We can have only one `else` statement under `if` statements continuously
  
Hint: noHint
         
Explanation: We can have multiple `if` statements continuosly but only one else statement after a single or multiple `if` statement.

##### Can we define `else if` block in Solidity?  

- [ ]  Else if block can be defined but only inside the struct
- [x]  Else if block doesn't exist in Solidity so we can't define it
- [ ]  Else if can be defined but only above the `if` block
- [ ]  Else if can be defined but only below the `else` block
  
Hint: Doesn't exist
         
Explanation: Else if doesn't exist in solidity. `Else if` is also a statement like `if` but it will be executed only if all of the preceding `if` or `else if` statements in the code block are false. Else if do exist in other programming langiages like c,c++, JavaScript.

##### Is it possible to convert non-boolean to boolean in solidity example `if(1)`?  

- [x]  No
- [ ]  Yes
  
Hint: Boolean
         
Explanation: We cannot do type conversion from non-boolean to boolean in solidity

##### What is the datatype inside the paranthesis of an `if` statement?  

- [ ]  Int
- [ ]  String
- [x]  Boolean
- [ ]  Address
  
Hint: noHint
         
Explanation: The paranthesis in if statement contains a condition so the data type should be either true or false hence it is boolean value.
