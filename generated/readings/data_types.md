 **Introduction to Solidity Data types**

[![Introduction to Solidity Data types](https://img.youtube.com/vi/N1Jeeei_wtw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Jeeei_wtw)     

In this video we're looking at the data types available in Solidity.
This video explains about the use of -
* Value Types - Integers , Booleans etc 
* Reference Types - Structs , Arrays .
* Mapping Type - Mapping.
    
 **Solidity Tutorial - Variable Types**

[![Solidity Tutorial - Variable Types](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TNZLonjrLYE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNZLonjrLYE)     

In this video we are looking at an overview of all the variable types in Solidity and how to declare them.
This video explains about all the variables that can be declared using types : 
* uint
* bytes32
* string
* bytes
* arrays
* mappings
* structs
* enums
    
 **Master Solidity Variables, Data Types, and Structs Master Solidity**

In this video we are looking at different solidity types and variables.
This video explains all the different variables that can be declared (state variables and Local Variables).
    
 **Solidity Tutorial, Arrays (Declare, Read, Update, Delete).**

[![Solidity Tutorial, Arrays (Declare, Read, Update, Delete).](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MPBOnChpi0c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPBOnChpi0c)     

This video explains how to - 
- Declare arrays
- Add elements
- Read elements
- Update elements
- Delete elements
- Iterate through elements
This video further explores the differences between-
- Fixed-size and Dynamic size
- Storage and memory arrays
and it also covers how to accept arrays argument in Solidity functions and return arrays from solidity functions.
    
 **Solidity Tutorial: Mappings (simple mappings, nested mappings, array in mappings...)**

[![Solidity Tutorial: Mappings (simple mappings, nested mappings, array in mappings...)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/U-wWqTq1zoQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-wWqTq1zoQ)     

This video explains how to declare and manipulate mappings in Solidity. It also covers simple mappings but also advanced mappings like nested mappings and array inside mappings. 
    
 **Solidity Tutorial, Arrays (Declare, Read, Update, Delete).**

[![Solidity Tutorial, Arrays (Declare, Read, Update, Delete).](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UkdU0cuAp9U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkdU0cuAp9U)     

Solidity Structs allow you to represent structured data. This video explains how to declare, instantiate (create), read, update and delete structs in Solidity.
It will also show some more advanced struct manipulation like how to declare an array of structs and how to declare a mapping of structs.
    
 **Solidity Tutorial, Arrays (Declare, Read, Update, Delete).**

[![Solidity Tutorial, Arrays (Declare, Read, Update, Delete).](https://img.youtube.com/vi/5ED_6FasZ68/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ED_6FasZ68)     

Solidity Enums allow you to represent optional data.
This video covers how to declare enums, use enums, accept enums as argument in solidity functions.
