 ## Your First Solidity Smart Contract
 
  **Declaring a function**
 
 [![Declaring a function](https://img.youtube.com/vi/null/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=null)     
 
 This video covers 
1) Function declaration in Solidity 
2) View functions (read-only) and non-view functions (can change Blockchain data).
    
 
 Sub Topics: functions    
  **Function Modifiers**

 Function modifiers allow your code to have less repetitive, re-useable code logic. This video explains the declaration and use of modifiers.
    
 
 Sub Topics: modifiers    
  **Events**
 
 [![Events](https://img.youtube.com/vi/null/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=null)     
 
 In Solidity, you can use events to push data to outside consumers, like web frontends.
This video shows how to declare and emit events in Solidity.
    
 
 Sub Topics: events    
  **Error Handling**
 
 [![Error Handling](https://img.youtube.com/vi/null/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=null)     
 
 Solidity uses state-reverting exceptions to handle errors. 
This video covers how error handling in solidity is done using revert, require, assert and try/catch.
    
 
 Sub Topics: errors, revert, require, try-catch, assert    
  **Structure of Smart contract**
 
 [![Structure of Smart contract](https://img.youtube.com/vi/null/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=null)     
 
 This video explains the typical layout of a Solidity source file: 
1) Pragma statement
2) Imports
3) Contract declaration
4) Variable 
5) Function declarations
    
 
 Sub Topics: file-layout, contract-structure
